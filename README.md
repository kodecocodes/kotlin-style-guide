# The Official raywenderlich.com Kotlin Style Guide (in progress)

This style guide is different from others you may see, because the focus is centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to keep the code in our tutorials consistent.

Our overarching goals are __conciseness__, __readability__ and __simplicity__.

You should also check out our other style guides:

* [Swift](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
* [Objective-C](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide)
* [Java](https://github.com/raywenderlich/java-style-guide)

## Inspiration

This style-guide is somewhat of a mash-up between the existing Kotlin language style guides, and a tutorial-readability focused Swift style-guide. The language guidance is drawn from: 

- The [Android Kotlin style guide](https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/style.html)
- The [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) 
- The [Android contributors style guide](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
- The [Google Java Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html).

Alterations to support additional readability in tutorials were inspired by the [raywenderlich.com Swift style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

## Android Studio Coding Style

It is possible to get Android Studio to adhere to these style guidelines, via a rather complex sequence of menus. To make it easier, we've provided a coding style that can be imported into Android Studio.

The file can be found [here](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/rwstyle.xml_.zip).

To install the file, open Android Studio Settings and go to **Editor > Code Style > Kotlin**, then click the gear menu and choose **Import Scheme...**.

From now on, projects you create _should_ follow the correct style guidelines.

## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow Java standards, as Kotlin is a JVM-compatible language.

### Packages

Package names are similar to Java: all __lower-case__, multiple words concatenated together, without hypens or underscores:

__BAD__:

```kotlin
com.RayWenderlich.funky_widget
```

__GOOD__:

```kotlin
com.raywenderlich.funkywidget
```

### Classes & Interfaces

Written in __UpperCamelCase__. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Methods

Written in __lowerCamelCase__. For example `setValue`.

### Fields

Generally, written in __lowerCamelCase__. Fields should **not** be named with Hungarian notation, as Hungarian notation is [erroneously thought](http://jakewharton.com/just-say-no-to-hungarian-notation/) to be recommended by Google.

Example field names:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
  var publicField: Int = 0
  val person = Person()
  private var privateField: Int?
}
```

Constant values in the companion object should be written in __uppercase__, with an underscore separating words:

```kotlin
companion object {
  const val THE_ANSWER = 42
}
```

### Variables & Parameters

Written in __lowerCamelCase__.

Single character values must be avoided, except for temporary looping variables.

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

__BAD:__

```kotlin
XMLHTTPRequest
URL: String? 
findPostByID
```
__GOOD:__

```kotlin
XmlHttpRequest
url: String
findPostById
```

## Declarations

### Visibility Modifiers

Only include visibility modifiers if you need something other than the default of public.

**BAD:**

```kotlin
public val wideOpenProperty = 1
private val myOwnPrivateProperty = "private"
```

**GOOD:***

```kotlin
val wideOpenProperty = 1
private val myOwnPrivateProperty = "private"
```

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and member variables.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
username: String
twitterHandle: String
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where scoping appropriate.

### Data Type Objects

Prefer data classes for simple data holding objects.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
  override fun toString() : String {
    return "Person(name=$name)"
  }
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String)
```

### Enum Classes

**TODO: UPDATE FOR KOTLIN** *(This is java-only and may not be true with Kotlin)*

Enum classes should be avoided where possible, due to a large memory overhead. Static constants are preferred. See http://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html#Overhead for further details.

Enum classes without methods may be formatted without line-breaks, as follows:

```kotlin
private enum CompassDirection { EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH }
```

## Spacing

Spacing is especially important in raywenderlich.com code, as code needs to be easily readable as part of the tutorial. 

### Indentation

Indentation is using spaces - never tabs.

#### Blocks

Indentation for blocks uses 2 spaces (not the default 4):

__BAD:__

```kotlin
for (i in 0..9) {
    Log.i(TAG, "index=" + i);
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
for (i in 0..9) {
  Log.i(TAG, "index=" + i)
}
```

#### Line Wraps

Indentation for line wraps should use 4 spaces (not the default 8):

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val widget: CoolUiWidget =
        someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line)
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
val widget: CoolUiWidget =
    someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line)
```

### Line Length

Lines should be no longer than 100 characters long.


### Vertical Spacing

There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.

## Semicolons

Semicolons ~~are dead to us~~ should be avoided wherever possible in Kotlin. 

__BAD__:

```kotlin
val horseGiftedByTrojans = true;
if (horseGiftedByTrojans) {
  bringHorseIntoWalledCity();
}
```

__GOOD__:

```kotlin
val horseGiftedByTrojans = true
if (horseGiftedByTrojans) {
  bringHorseIntoWalledCity()
}
```

## Getters & Setters

Unlike Java, direct access to fields in Kotlin is preferred. 

If custom getters and setters are required, they should be declared [following Kotlin conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html) rather than as separate methods.

## Brace Style

Only trailing closing-braces are awarded their own line. All others appear the same line as preceding code:

__BAD:__

```kotlin
class MyClass
{
  fun doSomething()
  {
    if (someTest)
    {
      // ...
    }
    else
    {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
class MyClass {
  fun doSomething() {
    if (someTest) {
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Conditional statements are always required to be enclosed with braces, irrespective of the number of lines required.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
if (someTest)
  doSomething()
if (someTest) doSomethingElse()
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
if (someTest) {
  doSomething()
}
if (someTest) { doSomethingElse() }
```

## When Statements

Unlike `switch` statements in Java, `when` statements do not fall through. Separate cases using commas if they should be handled the same way. Always include the else case.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
when (anInput) {
  1 -> doSomethingForCaseOne()
  2 -> doSomethingForCaseOneOrTwo()
  3 -> doSomethingForCaseThree()
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
when (anInput) {
  1, 2 -> doSomethingForCaseOneOrTwo()
  3 -> doSomethingForCaseThree()
  else -> println("No case satisfied")
}
```

## Annotations

Standard annotations should be used - in particular `override`. This should appear on the same line as the function declaration.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}
```

## Types 

Always use Kotlin's native types when available. Kotlin is JVM-compatible so **[TODO: more info]**

### Type Inference

Type inference should be preferred where possible to explicitly declared types. 

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val something: MyType = MyType()
val meaningOfLife: Int = 42
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
val something = MyType()
val meaningOfLife = 42
```

### Constants vs. Variables 

Constants are defined using the `val` keyword, and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `val` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

*Tip*: A good technique is to define everything using `val` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

### Companion Objects

** TODO: A bunch of stuff about companion objects **

### Nullable Types

Declare variables and function return types as nullable with `?` where a `null` value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `onCreate` for an Activity or `onCreateView` for a Fragment.

When naming nullable variables and parameters, avoid naming them like `nullableString` or `maybeView` since their nullability is already in the type declaration.

When accessing a nullable value, use the safe call operator if the value is only accessed once or if there are many nullables in the chain:

```kotlin
editText?.setText("foo")
```

**TODO: Update the rest of this section from Swift**

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

For optional binding, shadow the original name when appropriate rather than using names like unwrappedView or actualLabel.

```swift
Preferred:

var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}
```

Not Preferred:

```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}
``` 

## XML Guidance

Since Android uses XML extensively in addition to Kotlin and Java, we have some rules specific to XML. These can be found in our [Java code standards](https://github.com/raywenderlich/java-style-guide#xml-guidance


## Language

Use `en-US` English spelling. 🇺🇸

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val colourName = "red"
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
colorName = "red"
```

## Smiley Face

Smiley faces are a very prominent style feature of the raywenderlich.com site! It is very important to have the correct smile signifying the immense amount of happiness and excitement for the coding topic. The closing square bracket ] is used because it represents the largest smile able to be captured using ASCII art. A closing parenthesis ) creates a half-hearted smile, and thus is not preferred.

Bad:

    :)

Good:

    :]
